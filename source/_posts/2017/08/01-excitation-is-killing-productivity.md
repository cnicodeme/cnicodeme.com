I don’t know about you, but when I’m working on a project, I sometimes have a few moment of excitations thinking about the future, how the project will be, how that specific feature I’m working on will trigger some great feedback when I’ll start to talk about it…

Even though those excitations are what motivate me to work on the project, they tend to kill my productivity. I tend to stray away from the current work and start to wander in my imaginary land.

Moreover, those imaginary moments are just that, imaginary! And often, the reality is harsher, that feature will go unnoticed and that’s all.

We, Humans, are creature that doesn’t live in the present. We live in the past or the future. We always are thinking about something that happened, or how thing will happen. And the situation here is a typical example of that.

The issue with this is that those moments are a thing from the far away future and I tend to forget about all the hard work in-between. That specific feature is not ready yet, and once it will be, after hours of work, I will still have to genuinely find a solution to promote it in the best way possible. Meaning I will have to work more in order to achieve what my brain thought about the future three months from now.

It’s easy to become distracted by the things that motivate us. It’s easy to become distracted by the great future that is in front of us, but in order to achieve it, we need to think about the hard work in between.

Success doesn’t happen overnight.
