Hi! I'm Cyril Nicodeme

I am a French web developer passionate in building services. My favorite stack is Python (Flask) with VueJS.

I founded [Reflectiv](https://reflectiv.net) with my friend, [Antoine Minoux](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aminoux/), and we've built various online services, including [VoilaNorbert](https://voilanorbert.com) and [Transferslot](https://transferslot.com), which we recently sold.

I'm now focusing my time on [PDFShift](https://pdfshift.io) - an HTML to PDF API conversion, and [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com) - an email forwarding service.

Feel free to contact me to talk about anything! Happy to chat!
