As a developer, when I was reading that “developing your product is just the tip of the iceberg”, I was thinking it wasn’t true.
When you see all the hard work you have to put into it, your mind doesn’t accept the fact that this is only the easy part.

And I was wrong.

The thing is, your product can be the most complicated thing on earth, it doesn’t matter. Once your product is online, what matter is bringing customers in.

When you start thinking about it, you quickly realize that even though there is plenty of possibilities to get your word out, it’s not as easy as you initially thought. You have to fight against competitors, you have to be clever on how you deliver your message in order to bring more visitors and you have to be even more clever to convert them as customers.

The problem is that I’m just a simple developer and marketing as never been my strong suit.

But I’m also pretty sure I’m not the only one.

That’s why I decided to start this blog, related to my recent project, [SellDom](https://www.selldom.io).

I plan to try a variety of techniques, free and paid, and see what works, how much, and the ROI for each techniques.

My objective here is to share with you my experiences in marketing and hopefully, getting better and better in this strange word.

I already have a list of … things to try — I wouldn’t say “techniques” because some of them doesn’t have the requirements to be considered technical — but I need your help.

I need your help in suggesting me what to try. Considering it won’t be expensive, I’ll try them, share my experience about it, the difficulty, the results and the ROI from it.

In the end, if all goes well, this blog will be a directory of what works and what doesn’t, but keep in mind these results are loosely tied with my business and you will have completely differents results with yours.

But it’s worth a try, isn’t it?
